# dŵr VTA for SME
"dŵr VTA for SME" is a mechanical device to provide easy VTA changes on tonearms requiring a SME cutout. The design aims to provide for changes which are repeatable and measurable, while maintaining mounting rigidity.

## Description

The presented device aims to provide a means for vertical movement of the entire tonearm base to facilitate for changes to both VTA (Vertical Tracking Angle) and SRA (Stulus Rake Angle). It utilizes a precise micrometer head with a ⌀ 9.5mm mounting collar, and a sealed rolling bearing (SKF 638/5-2Z - 5x11x5) to provide rolling support. Stability is maintained via the use of ⌀ 4mm bronze pins that ride within PTFE bushings. Rigidity is maintained via the use of a locking thumbscrew on the rear end of the base.

The use of a micrometer head to provide for VTA adjustments is certainly not a novel idea - one early (and brilliant) example is the Audiomods tonearm series designed by Jeff Spall. What is different with this approach is:

- The ability to add VTA/SRA adjustments while not losing the sliding base typical for SME tonearms to allow for overhang adjustment on non-slotted headshels;
- The SME screening can with the terminal block is fully retained.

This mechanism completely replaces the SME base plate, and has provisions for machine screw mounting (M4 countersunk) to the armboard.

## Materials

The mechanism is machined out of 6061 aluminium which is then clear anodized to provide for longevity. The gliding pins are machined out of bronze, and the sliding bushings out of PTFE (a more easily machinable alternative is POM). There are no restrictions to the materials that can be used as long as they satisfy the requirements of (1) being rigid, (2) non-magnetic and (3) machinable.

A few prototypes using PLA 3D printing have been made, but I would not rely on them for longevity. YMMV.

The rolling bearing can be any 5x11x5 size, but needs to be sealed to protect against contamination.

The micrometer head can be any with a ⌀ 9.5mm mounting collar. Anything else needs careful reaming of the mounting position.

## Variants

Within the repository, both DXF and PDF drawings are provided for two variants of the mechanism, a HIGH and a LOW variant:

- HIGH uses two 10mm thick plates for a minimum height of the base plate of 20mm;
- LOW uses two 5mm thick plates for a minimum height of the base plate of 10mm.

While theoretically, one could make the base plate even thinner, I would advised against in order to not lose rigidity. Additionally, a thinner bearing may need to be used.

## Drawbacks

A portion of the sliding base movement (±3mm) has been lost in order for the stabilising pins to be mounted and retain a clean look.
